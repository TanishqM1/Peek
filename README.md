#  PeekAssistant ‚Äî Lightweight AI Overlay

A minimal, desktop-only assistant that lets you instantly capture screenshots, enter prompts, or both ‚Äî and get real-time answers via GPT-4o.

---

##  Current Functionality

PeekAssistant enables users to:

-  **Take screenshots** using a snipping tool overlay
-  **Enter prompts** to send questions or context
-  **Combine screenshot + prompt** for full context AI requests
-  **Toggle features** using global or in-focus hotkeys
-  **Stay out of your way** with a transparent, minimal UI and frameless design

All input is formatted and sent to the OpenAI API using GPT-4o, returning intelligent responses based on the visual and/or textual context provided. 
The goal of PeekAssitant is to be a 'stay-out-of-your-way' desktop agent that can be be used using only hotkeys, anywhere on your desktop.
