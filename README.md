# Current Functionality
> Users are able to use PeekAssistant to capture screenhsots, enter prompts, or both using a simple hotkey from anywhere on their desktop. PeekAssistant will prompt users to take a screenshot and/or enter prompts for AI. The information is then formatted into a request to the OpenAI API platform where GPT 4.0 is used to answer and solve problems. There are additional features to make the app minimalistic such as toggling visibility, and transparent UI designs where possible to ensure PeekAssitant doesn't take up any window space.


# Upcoming Features and Bug Fixes

### UI Design
- Working on created a minimalistic UI design for "PeekAssistant", helping users utilize features without taking up too much window space or causing a distraction.
- Focusing on creating a clean responsive user-prompt window for AI prompting.
- Developing scripts to minimize window clutter when events like screenshots and prompts are open, to minimize the effect it has on other windows open.


### Backend Functionality
- Developing AI prompting functionality based on user parameters and information given.
- Developing hotkeys to handle PeekAssistant visibility, toggling screenshot/prompting features, and exitting the application.
- Developing features to allow the application to work alongside other windows in Bordered Fullscreen without causing interruptions.

### Future Updates/Ideas
- Allow users to switch between AI models based on their situation (i.e Claude for coding, Gemini for visual tasks, or GPT for standard tasks).
- Allow users to tweak parameters using an "Advanced" mode in the application
- Allow users to save multiple screenshots, or files as projects to use older information as a part of their prompt.


#### current hotkeys
- "f4" executes the program, and begins screenshot/prompting.
- "ctrl+alt+q" exits the program.
- "ctrl+h" toggles visilbity.
- "ctrl+s" toggles the screenshot swtich.
- "ctrl+p" toggles the propmt switch.
